# Node connectivity

We connect Nodes to the cluster network in a similar way as Pods.
That is, to create a veth pair and connect one side to the network.
The following is a summary of differences between Pods and Nodes.

|              | Pod (CNI)                | Node                        |
|:-------------|:-------------------------|:----------------------------|
| IPAM         | host-local               | 2nd IP of podCIDR           |
| contNS       | args.Netns (from docker) | host namespace              |
| contVethName | args.IfName ("eth0")     | fixed ("midokube-node")     |
| hostVethName | generated from NS/Pod    | fixed ("midokube-mido")     |
| MidoNet port | pod.IDForKey(podKey)     | node.PortIDForKey(nodename) |
